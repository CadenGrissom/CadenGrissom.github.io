	<p id= "mainbody"> In all my adult life I have worked. I started out working in the cattle industry, by creating
		my own cattle company. From there I worked in the service industry, the construction industry, and for a brief
		time I worked in the film industry. Needless to say I have a good work ethic, and know the value of a hard earned
		dollar. Beyond work ethic, I have been told that I am thoughtful, and curious.</p>
